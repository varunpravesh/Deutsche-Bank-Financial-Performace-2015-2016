The bank provides a comprehensive range of financial services, including investment banking, corporate banking, asset management, and retail banking.

This report provides a comprehensive trend analysis of Deutsche Bank's financial performance, focusing on revenue growth, profitability trends, and expense dynamics for the years 2015 and 2016.

## Overview
From 2015 to 2016, the company’s financials show a picture of modest revenue growth paired with increasing leverage and slightly eroding profitability. Revenue and Operating income both rose by 1%, yet net income and cash flow both declined by 1%. This small dip in net income despite revenue growth indicates rising costs or additional expenses (such as interest or taxes) that are offsetting the incremental gains in revenue.
Meanwhile, the total assets contracted by 1%, while liabilities grew by 3%, leading to an increase in both the debt-to-equity (up 6%) and debt-to-asset (up 10%) ratios.The Return on equity (ROE) and Return on assets (ROA) remained flat, which implies the company’s overall efficiency in generating returns did not improve despite higher liabilities and a marginally lower asset base.A small reduction in tax expense (down 2%) may be related to shifts in the company’s effective tax rate or timing of certain tax items.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Revenue and Income Trends
![](Images/RevenueNetIncome.png)

- Revenue fluctuates across both years but remains relatively stable. In 2015, revenue shows a slight upward trend with fluctuations. In 2016, revenue decreases at the start but recovers in the middle of the year before stabilizing.
- Operating income follows a similar pattern to revenue but with smaller fluctuations. Operating income is consistently positive, suggesting the company is generating profits from its core business operations. A dip in mid-2016 is observed, which could indicate increased operating expenses or lower sales.
-  Net Income is more volatile, suggesting additional external factors like taxes, interest expenses, or extraordinary costs affect final profits. The company remains profitable throughout both years, as net income is always positive.

### Profit Trends

#### Profit Margin

- Despite starting lower in Q1 2016 compared to Q1 2015, each subsequent quarter shows improvement. By Q4 2016, revenue matches (and slightly exceeds) Q4 2015.
- 2015’s margins decline steadily through the year. In contrast, 2016 starts off with a lower margin (Q1) but then surges in Q3 to 30%, which is the highest margin across both years. This spike may suggest a combination of cost reductions, pricing strategies, or one-time factors boosting profitability in that quarter.

#### Profitability Ratios

- Both years show monthly swings, with 2015 reaching an absolute peak of 12% ROE and 2016 peaking at 11%. The early months (January) are consistently the weakest in both years.
- ROA remains relatively steady between 1% and 3% in both 2015 and 2016, indicating that changes in net income have a more pronounced impact on equity returns than on total assets.
- Both years feature elevated ROE/ROA around late spring and summer (May through August). This may be because of seasonal influences or other business factors.

### Assets and Liabilities

#### Declining Assets and Growing Liabilities

- Assets consistently exceed Liabilities in both 2015 and 2016, suggesting positive net worth or equity. However, the declining peak of Assets from 2015 to 2016 might be worth looking into.
- In December of each year, Assets settle around $260M–$270M, while Liabilities settle around $210M in 2015 and near $200M in 2016. Despite mid-year ups and downs, the ending positions are relatively stable.
